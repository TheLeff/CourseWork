# CourseWork

My Course Work after the first year of Software Engineering. I was asked to do a simple app in C but I decided to go for something harder.

It's a simple Android Application which essentially is just a word scramble.
It supports 2 vocabularies, both of them are in /raw folders.
I designed UI for 10.1" tablet.

It's plain and simple but I highly recommend to check out other ways to deal with certain situations because 
I am not sure those were the best ones in my work.
